//! The UniFFI surface over [`gallery_scan`] and the `gallery-meta` read side.
//!
//! # Why this is a session and not three free functions
//!
//! A scan is request/response: the app asks, waits, and uses the answer, so
//! none of the [`crate::support`] run-thread machinery applies — there is no
//! listener to notify, no summary to publish, no "already running" to report.
//! The Store already owns the concurrency policy (dedupe, two-phase ordering,
//! the 48-hour promotion).
//!
//! The cancel flag still needs somewhere to live, and it is per-*app* rather
//! than per-call: by definition it has to be reachable from a thread that is
//! not the one blocked inside `scan`.
//!
//! [`ScannerSession`] is that home. It holds no scan state between calls: the
//! cache goes in with each request and the outcome comes straight back out.
//! The walk is always local ([`StdVfs`]); there is no platform probe.
//!
//! # Why the tree comes back flat
//!
//! [`PhotoFolder`] owns its photos by value, so shipping the recursive tree and
//! the flat list would put every photo on the wire twice — 40k records for a
//! 20k library. [`ScanFolderNode`] instead carries a parent index and a
//! `(photo_start, photo_count)` slice into `flat_photos`; each folder's photos
//! are contiguous there because the walk appends them a directory at a time.
//! Swift rebuilds the tree from the slices in one linear pass.
