/// On-device face detection, clustering and naming: owns the Rust core's

/// A sibling of `TaggingService` in every structural respect — session held
/// across runs, `cancelRequested` covering the window before a run exists,
/// off-actor open/release, root-scoped runs, the shared
/// `SidecarRefreshCoalescer` — and different in exactly one: the core's face
/// surface has calls that write to disk *without* being a run. Naming a
/// cluster, un-naming it, ignoring it, rejecting it, merging two, splitting one
/// and renaming a person all rewrite sidecars, and all of them are refused by
/// the core while
/// a run is in flight. So `isRunning` gates the review UI's buttons, not just
/// its progress row.
///
/// ## How results surface
///
/// Exactly as tagging's do, and for the same reason: the core writes
/// `People/<Name>` keywords and `mwg-rs:RegionInfo` regions into `.xmp` files
/// the last scan never saw, so nothing in the app knows about them until a
/// **light rescan** rebuilds the sidecar manifest → `SidecarSyncService` →
/// `reapplySidecarMerges()` → tags/indexes/widget. `PeopleStore` then shows the
/// new person through the ordinary People machinery, with a face-region cover
/// crop, with no reader changes anywhere.
///
    /// A run triggers that refresh from `onSidecarsWritten` (per-photo stamps
